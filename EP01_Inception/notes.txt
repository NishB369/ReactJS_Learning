1. Created an HTML file
    -> created a div with a heading - "Hello World" using HTML syntax

2. Created a JS script
    -> created a div with a heading - "Hello World" using JS syntax
    -> browser runs the JS code with a JS engine that controls the rendering engine depending on DOM strucutre and its manipulations defined in the code.

    -> browser doesn't know anything about ReactJS, so we have to provide it an environment to be able to execute and render our ReactJS syntax based code logic.

3. Getting react to our project
    -> Way 01. CDN

        -> it is a place where our required things is available and we are pulling it from the nearest available server for speed, scalabilty etc benefites.

        -> what is CDN?
            -> A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. Here’s a brief overview of what a CDN does and its benefits:
            
            What is a CDN?
                Definition: A CDN is a network of servers located in various geographical locations that work together to deliver content (like images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, etc.) to users more efficiently.

                How it Works: When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects that request to the nearest server in its network. This reduces latency and speeds up the loading time of the content.
                
                Benefits:
                    Faster Load Times: By serving content from a location closer to the user, CDNs can significantly reduce the time it takes for a webpage to load.

                    Reduced Bandwidth Costs: CDNs can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the origin server, which can lower hosting costs.

                    Improved Availability and Redundancy: If one server goes down, the CDN can reroute requests to another server, ensuring that the content remains available.

                    Scalability: CDNs can handle spikes in traffic more effectively than a single server, making them ideal for high-traffic websites.

                Common Uses of CDNs
                    Hosting libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery, and GSAP.

                Serving images, videos, and other media files.

                Distributing static assets for web applications.

            In summary, a CDN is a powerful tool for improving the performance and reliability of web applications by distributing content across multiple servers.

        -> what is crossorigin?
            -> smjh nhi aya

        -> clicked the link
            -> found large js code file
            -> react is a js library, react is at the end of the day is js code!
            -> code written by Facebook!

        -> upon injecting CDN   
            -> we have got React

        -> we have got 2 files  
            -> react.development.js
                • core of react
            -> react-dom.development.js
                • react lib used to manipulate DOM (bridge to usecase)

            -> why 2 files?
                -> react doesn't only works on browsers
                -> mobile - react_native
                -> 3d - react fiber
